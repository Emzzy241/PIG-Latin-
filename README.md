<!-- Wrting out each specs from little to large
NOTE: THIS SPEC WILL WORK BUT IT WASN'T SEPARATING MY 2 LOGIC SO I HAD TO START IT AGAIN. IF I WAS TO SEPARATE LOGIC 
IN THIS I WOULD BE NEEDING A "return true" keyword BUT return; and break; BOTH DON'T WORK IN forEach LOOPS SO 
I WILL BE USING forLoop IN THE NEW SPEC BELOW

1. the first spec is writing a function to know if a word starts from vowels: I will be writing a function,
in that function I would first create an array for my vowels and then use .forEach function to check if the input user gave me starts with a vowel with the code below


function wordsStartingWithAVowel(vowelWords)({

    let vowels = ["a", "e","i", "o", "u"];

    vowels.forEach( function(aVowelWord){
        if (aVowelWord === vowels){

        }
    });
});

NOW I am done with the first spec, moving on to the next.

2. THe second spec is updating our previous function to do something when we know what user's Input is, and when we 
know whether the input starts with a vowel

Assuming we have collected user's input, stored it in a variable 

function wordsStartingWithAVowel(vowelWords)({

    let vowels = ["a", "e","i", "o", "u"];

    vowels.forEach( function(aVowelWord){
        if (aVowelWord === vowels){
            userInput = userInput.concat("way");
        }
    });
});


IN the above code, our business Logic is depending upon the value of a user which is not a good way of separating
our 2 logic's to avoid that, I will be starting my specs section again

 --> 

<!-- THE NEW SPEC THAT CAREFULLY SEPARATES MY 2 LOGIC
1.  The first detail of my code is for words that starts with a vowel, this time around I would be using 
a forLoop so we can return true immediately we notice a word starts with a vowel: so in the function, first I would 
create an array of vowels, then I run my forLoop I give it the 4 arguments a forLoop takes and then use my return true;
keyword.... then in that forLoop I will run a conditional stating if functionParameter(in this case it is checkVowelWords)
so if checkVowelWords.charAt(0) === vowelArray[i] we should return true otherwise return false
HERE IS THE CODE:
    
    function wordsStartingWithAVowel(checkVowelWords){
        let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

        for(let i = 0; i < vowels.length; i++){
            if(checkVowelWords.charAt(0) === vowels[i]){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

NOTE: THE TEST FOR THIS IS DOWN BELOW







 -->


<!-- THE NEXT SPEC
2. Yes we have written a nice function that checks if the first letter of our word is a vowel, but when we enter 
uppercase letters, this test fails woefully, so to prevent this now we need to take in vowels whether they're capitalized
or not... To do this we are just going to update our previous function
CODE:
        function wordsStartingWithAVowel(checkVowelWords){
        let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];

        for(let i = 0; i < vowels.length; i++){
            if(checkVowelWords.charAt(0).toLowerCase() === vowels[i]){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

So all we had to just do here was to put in the .toLowerCase() method and it completely worked
NOW OUR FUNCTION IS GOOD TO GO AND WILL WORK WHETHER OR NOT IF USER ENTERS A CAPITAL LETTER FIRST OR A SMALL LETTER FIRST
 -->






 <!-- THE NEXT SPEC 
 3. Still following my algorithm, the next should be writing a function for words starting with qu
 No forLoop is needed here because this is a simple function that can be executed with a conditional and with a new method called .slice()... this slices out the characters you want and you can now choose to store them back in the variable.... So back to the next spec, to solve this now I will create a function: wordsStartingWithQu... I will first create a variable for storing the sliced value of the words enterred and then I use a conditional... Here is the CODE:

    function wordsStartingWithQu(thisWord){
        let storingSlicedValue = thisWord.slice(0, 2);
        if( storingSlicedValue === "qu"){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false;
        }
    }


A TEST HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO PASS THIS SPEC, MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SPEC FOR CAPITALIZATION 
 -->

<!-- NEXT SPEC
4. I have done a test that checks if a word starts with "qu" but I haven't taking instances for capitalization and that could be a great mistake in my code... To prevent that now I update my previous function and add in the method .toLowerCase(), so whether the user inputs the qu word with capital letters or not, my function still sees it as just "qu"
CODE:

    function wordsStartingWithQu(thisWord){
        let storingSlicedValue = thisWord.slice(0, 2);
        if( storingSlicedValue.toLowerCase() === "qu"){
            return true;
        }
        else{
            return false
        }
    }


A TEST HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO PASS THIS SPEC AND IT HAS BEEN PASSED, MOVING ON TO THE NEXT

<!--  I DIDN'T USE THIS AGAIN....THE NEXT SPEC: THE THIRD FUNCTION TO CHECK IF FIRST TWO WORDS ARE VOWEL
    I have already determined if a first word is vowel and it has been used in my algorithm in scripts.js
    what if I want to determine if the first 2 letters in a word are vowels... I HAVE TO CREATE A NEW FUNCTION AND TEST FOR IT... I first created in my vowel array's variable, then I stored the splitted form of my word as an array also and then I used forLoop,  and lastly a conditional.. this is a powerful function so I would be needing another function in it

        function firstTwoWordsStartingWithAVowel(thisWord){
            
            let thisWordArray = thisWord.split("");
            for (let i = 0; i < thisWordArray.length; i++){
                if(isVowel(thisWordArray[i])){
                    return true;
                }
            } return false;

            

        }



THE FOURTH FUNCTION

            function isVowel(letter){
                let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
                for( let i = 0; i < vowels.length; i++){
                    if( letter === vowels[i]){
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                return false;
            }
        } return thisWordArray.length;


 -->


<!-- THE NEXT SPEC: THE THIRD FUNCTION IS TO CHECK FOR VOWELS, SO WE ARE

    function wordIsVowel(letter){
        let vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"];
        for( let i = 0; i < vowels.length; i++){
            if( letter === vowels[i]){
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    THIS ONE AND THE NEXT FUNCTION BOTH WORK IN HANDY BECAUSE WE'RE CALLING IT HERE



 -->

 <!-- THE FOURTH FUNCTION IS TO CHECK IF THE CHARACTER INDEX OF A WORD IS A VOWEL

    function firstVowelIndex(thisWord){
        let wordArray = thisWord.split("");
        for ( let i = 0; wordArray.length; i++){
            if(wordIsVowel(wordArray[i])){
                return 1;
            } 
        } return wordArray.length;
    }
